Because Matt had worked in the industry for a decade, he knew Coava couldn\u2019t roast exceptional coffee without sourcing from the best farmers in the world. Today we are proud to feature single origin coffees from meticulous, hard-working farmers who take risks to work exclusively with us.\n \nOur name, Coava, was inspired by Englishman William Biddulph, who traveled to Turkey in the 1600s and discovered that \u201ccoava\u201d was a term for unroasted coffee, a word previously unknown in the Western world. Raw coffee is at the heart of what we do. We strive to create beautiful roast profiles based on the inherent qualities of each unroasted coffee. That\u2019s why we only roast single origins, focusing on quality, intensity and balance in the cup.\n \nAs a result, Coava is known for roasting some of the highest scoring coffees in the world, a craft we humbly practice in our roastery in Portland, Oregon."}}, {"pk": 11, "model": "roaster.roaster", "fields": {"name": "Coffee Bean Internation's Public Domain Caf\u00e9", "video_url": "", "phone": "(503) 243-6374", "url": "http://www.publicdomaincoffee.com/", "created_at": "2013-01-19T04:33:14.899Z", "cafes": [], "modified_at": "2013-01-19T04:38:33.201Z", "lat": "45.519967", "address": "603 Southwest Broadway\nPortland, Oregon", "active": true, "lng": "-122.679468", "photo_url": "", "slug": "coffee-bean-internations-public-domain-cafe", "description": ""}}, {"pk": 12, "model": "roaster.roaster", "fields": {"name": "Courier Coffee Roasters", "video_url": "", "phone": "(503) 545-6444", "url": "http://www.couriercoffeeroasters.com", "created_at": "2013-01-19T04:33:15.069Z", "cafes": [], "modified_at": "2013-01-19T04:38:33.370Z", "lat": "45.522534", "address": "923 SW Oak\nPortland Oregon", "active": true, "lng": "-122.679663", "photo_url": "", "slug": "courier-coffee-roasters", "description": "Located at 4019 SE Hawthorne both behind and below the house (basically off the parking lot of the Thai/Vietnamese restaurant ThanThao.\n\nWe come to fire up the roaster, to pack coffee into recycleable bags/ mason jars/ reusable tubs.

These we keep below the house where its cool dry and dark (mostly dry). Coffee for us is a fresh product with a greeny vibrancy that does not keep that long. Different coffees age differently in their seed form, but it is important to roast them while they are still new. The coffees in season always vary, and most of us in Portland buy seasonally.\n\nWe roast in a 25 pound steel drum San Franciscan, with an attached incinerator (afterburner). While the house on our address tag is a little shabby externally, the interior is a gem. Our main delivery bike is a long john style frame made by CAT in Eugene Oregon, with a custom aluminum front bed. The rated capacity of the front area is 200 pounds.
